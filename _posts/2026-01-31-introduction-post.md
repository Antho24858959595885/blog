 My setup experience



Setup was fairly standard, I had a lot of fun working through each file and moving them, it felt like I was a little working ant (no pun intended) building my own creation. I'm looking forward to posting and keeping this blog alive, I may want to take this project and turn it into a viable look into my life outside of school.



 What I Learned

- The first thing I learned was how these websites are actually created, it was really cool being able to lift up the veil and be on the other side of things. 

- Second thing I learned was how to augment files in the PowerShell, it was easier to move them with a command rather than picking them off one by one, and I've never done that before!

- Third thing I learned was how to start up a local server for a webpage, it was super simple and very easy to control.
